# Project 4: SQL - Shark Attacks

The aim of this project was data cleaning and exploratory analysis in PostgreSQL. I have used the real data regarding shark attacks over the world, analysing among others the attacks caused by various shark species, injuries in various body parts and in many countries 

**Skills used: group by, partition by, CTE, subqueries, mathematical and string operations, regex**

Project consist of 3 parts:

**PART 1: Creating the table** \
**PART 2: Cleaning the data** \
In this part I have gone over every column in the data, checked it distinct values, nulls and duplicates. I have clean the data, removing or changing incorrect entries, such as date in the future, or values other then Y and N in column with fatal attacks.
I have grouped data in categories (shark species, body part injured) and extracted the values from the text strings.

**PART 3: Data analysis** 

In this part I have answered the below questions:

***1. Which of the states in US have the higher amount of shark attacks?***


***2. What is the percentage of attacks between man and woman based on the available data?***


***3. Which of the US states has the higher rate of fatal attacts with regard to all attacks?***


***4. What is the percentage of fatal attacts between man and woman?***


***5. What percentage of all fatal attacks were provoked?***


***6. Is there a region where attacks by one shark specie are most common than by the other?***


***7. Which shark specie attacks more often?***


***8. Which shark spiecie is the most deadly?***


***9. Which body part is attacked by sharks the most often?***


***10. Which shark species attact which human body part?***


***11. What are the activities with the highest ratio of fatal attacks?***
